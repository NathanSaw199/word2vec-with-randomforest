df['review'] = df['review'].apply(lambda x:x.lower())

#We’re going to use the built-in function from gensim to handle the cleaning and tokenization for us. So we’re calling gensim’s cleaner, which is gensim.utils.simple_preprocess. This will remove all punctuation, remove stop words and tokenize the given sentence.

# print(df.head())

# Clean data using the built in cleaner in gensim
df['review_clean'] = df['review'].apply(lambda x : gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(x))

#Now training our model calling the word2vec model from the gensim package by passing necessary parameters are.
#size - size of the vectors we want
#window - number words before and after the focus word that it’ll consider as context for the word
#min_count - the number of times a word must appear in our corpus in order to create a word vector.

# Train the word2vec model

#Retrieves the vocabulary (all unique words) learned by the Word2Vec model during training.
w2v_model.wv.index_to_key

#This part of the code converts each sentence in the training and test datasets into arrays of word vectors using the trained Word2Vec model.
#set(): Converts the list of words into a Python set for faster membership checking (i in words) when processing sentences.
words = set(w2v_model.wv.index_to_key)
#the variable words now contains all the words in the Word2Vec vocabulary.
#for ls in X_train: Iterates over each preprocessed review (sentence) in the training dataset X_train. Each ls represents a tokenized sentence (list of words). ls is a list of words (tokens) from a single review
#X_train = [["movie", "amazing"],["film", "boring", "waste"]] .First iteration: ls = ["movie", "amazing"] .Second iteration: ls = ["film", "boring", "waste"]
#Iterates over each tokenized sentence (ls) in the training dataset X_train.
#If a review is "The movie was amazing", after preprocessing: ls = ["movie", "amazing"] 
#[w2v_model.wv[i] for i in ls if i in words]
#For each word i in the tokenized sentence ls, check if i is in the words set (i.e., if it has a Word2Vec representation)
#for i in ls if i in words: For each word i in the sentence ls Check if the word exists in the Word2Vec vocabulary (words) If the word exists, retrieve its vector representation using w2v_model.wv[i].
#If "movie" and "amazing" exist in the vocabulary. w2v_model.wv["movie"] → [vector representation of "movie"] . 2v_model.wv["amazing"] → [vector representation of "amazing"] 
#Suppose the Word2Vec model has learned the following vector representations: w2v_model.wv["movie"] = [0.1, 0.3, ..., 0.2]  # A 100-dimensional vector . w2v_model.wv["amazing"] = [0.5, 0.4, ..., 0.1] 
#For ls = ["movie", "amazing"], the inner list comprehension produces [w2v_model.wv["movie"], w2v_model.wv["amazing"]]
#Resulting in: [[0.1, 0.3, ..., 0.2],  # Vector for "movie"
# [0.5, 0.4, ..., 0.1]   # Vector for "amazing"]
#Convert to NumPy Array: np.array([...]) Converts the list of Word2Vec vectors for the words in a sentence into a NumPy array.Each sentence becomes a 2D array where each row is a 100-dimensional vector representing a word.
#Example: For ls = ["movie", "amazing"], the result might look like:
#np.array([
#     [0.1, 0.3, ..., 0.2],  # Vector for "movie"
#     [0.5, 0.4, ..., 0.1]   # Vector for "amazing"
# ])
#The result is a list of NumPy arrays, where each array represents a tokenized sentence.
#Each array contains the Word2Vec vectors for the words in that sentence.

#to Represent Sentence-Level Data Each sentence (ls) in X_train becomes one numpy array of word vectors. Without the outer brackets, you wouldn't retain the separation between sentences, and the sentence structure would be lost.
#X_train_vect = np.array([w2v_model.wv[i] for i in ls if i in words for ls in X_train]) This would flatten all the word vectors for all sentences into a single numpy array, losing the sentence boundaries.

#X_train_vect = [np.array([w2v_model.wv[i] for i in ls if i in words]) for ls in X_train]

#X_train_vect is needed to convert sentences into numerical representations (word embeddings) for machine learning or deep learning models. It organizes word vectors for each sentence into a structured format, preserving sentence-level information.

# Compute sentence vectors by averaging the word vectors for the words contained in the sentence
#This will store the computed sentence vectors for the training data.
#X_train_vect_avg is used to create a fixed-length vector for each sentence by averaging the word embeddings
#Create Fixed-Length Vectors: Sentences can have different numbers of words, resulting in variable-length embeddings. Averaging ensures every sentence is represented by a fixed-length vector.
#"I love AI."
#"AI is great."
# #I" → [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
# "love" → [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]
# "AI" → [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
# "is" → [0.1, 0.3, 0.5]
# "great" → [0.6, 0.7, 0.8]
# For "I love AI":Average= 

# [0.1+0.4+0.7,0.2+0.5+0.8,0.3+0.6+0.9]/3 =[0.4,0.5,0.6]
# The vector [0.4, 0.5, 0.6] that represents the sentence "I love AI" is a semantic representation of the sentence in the same vector space as the individual word embeddings.
# Machine learning models like classification, regression, clustering, etc., require numerical input. Since sentences are made up of words, and words have numerical representations (embeddings), you can represent the sentence as a single vector that encapsulates the meaning of the entire sentence.
# Instead of feeding a model individual words, you feed it the average vector of the sentence (in this case, [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]).This vector summarizes the entire sentence and is used in models that perform tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, or even machine translation.Sentences can be of varying lengths, but machine learning models typically expect input data to have a consistent size. Averaging the word embeddings creates a fixed-length vector representation of a sentence, regardless of how many words it contains.In the case of word embeddings, if each word is represented by a vector of size 3, the sentence is now represented by a single 3-dimensional vector, [0.4, 0.5, 0.6].The vector [0.4, 0.5, 0.6] represents the meaning of the sentence "I love AI" in the context of the embedding space, and it is needed because:It serves as a numerical representation of the sentence for machine learning models.It ensures the sentence is represented by a fixed-length vector for consistency in model input.It captures the semantic meaning of the sentence by averaging the meanings of the individual words in the sentence.

#Fit RandomForestClassifier On Top Of Word Vectors
#So we’ll just import our random forest classifier, we’ll use our default parameters, and then we’ll train it on the averaged word vectors (X_train_vect_avg, y_train) .

## Instantiate and fit a basic Random Forest model on top of the vectors
rf = RandomForestClassifier()
#y_train.values.ravel() ,Converts y_train into a 1D array: Ensures compatibility with the fit() function, which expects a 1D array for the target values.
# y_train.values  # Example: [[1], [0], [1], ...] , y_train.values.ravel()  # Output: [1, 0, 1, ...] 
#Example Imagine the classifier is trained on two sentences: Sentence 1: "The movie was amazing!" → Label: Positive (1) Sentence 2: "The movie was terrible!" → Label: Negative (0)
#If X_train_vect_avg and y_train look like:
# X_train_vect_avg = [
#     [0.2, 0.4, 0.5],  # Vector for "The movie was amazing!"
#     [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],  # Vector for "The movie was terrible!"
# ]
# y_train = [1, 0] 
#The model will learn:
#Sentences with vectors closer to [0.2, 0.4, 0.5] are likely positive. Sentences with vectors closer to [0.1, 0.2, 0.3] are likely negative.
rf_model = rf.fit(X_train_vect_avg,y_train.values.ravel())

#Now that we have our fit model, we’re going to call dot predict on that fit model and use the patterns that it learned in its training process and apply those to unseen text messages in the test data(X_test_vect_avg) and store those predictions in y_pred

## Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test_vect_avg)

#And then lastly, we’ll import our evaluation functions, precision and recall, we’ll calculate those metrics, and then we’ll print them out.

precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred)
# print('Precision: {} / Recall: {} / Accuracy: {}'.format(
#     round(precision, 3), round(recall, 3), round((y_pred==y_test).sum()/len(y_pred), 3)))
